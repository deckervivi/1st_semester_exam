            <h2>Basic Video</h2>

            <p>In this module we had to produce 2 minor video productions. We have created a short story on mobile phone and an information video for The Copenhagen Municipality.
The module includes an introduction to concept development using video, dramaturgy, journalistic reportage, film language and media elements and recording and editing techniques.

            </p>

                <h2>1. Narration without words</h2>

                <p>In this first project the task was to tell a story with images alone. No
 words can be spoken in the video.
                    The story must be about one of the following general themes:</p>
                <div class="list">
                    <li>Urban living</li>
                    <li>People who are too busy</li>
                    <li>Cycling in Copenhagen</li> </div>
<p>Sound and music could have been added for atmospheric purposes and the video should be no longer than two minutes.</p>

                <h2>2. City walk and meetup</h2>

                <p>The second project of the Video module was called City Walk and Meetup. A functional concept of two common events. Where people have the chance to meetup in comfortable place and perhaps served a refreshment or something.</p>
                <p>We were supposed to create a video that introduces the concept for the target audience: People
                that are not from Denmark, but have moved to and are living in Copenhagen. It can be students,
                but it does not have to be. </p>
